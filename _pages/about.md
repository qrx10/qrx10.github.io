I am currently a 5th year Engineering Physics student at [UBC](https://www.engphys.ubc.ca/) and an undergraduate research assistant in [AMPEL](https://www.ampel.ubc.ca/), supervised by [Dr. John D.W. Madden](https://mm.ece.ubc.ca/john-madden/), working on artificial skin for robots and smart roller for automated fibre placement. Prior to this, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant in [SimPL](https://simpl.mech.ubc.ca/), supervised by [Dr. Lyndia C. Wu](https://mech.ubc.ca/lyndia-wu/), working on balance adption tasks with EEG measurement and quantifying balance of hockey players using wearable sensors. I am doing my capstone project on the development of a nano-scale LIGO coating tester under the supervison of [Dr. Jeff F. Young](https://qmi.ubc.ca/team-member/jeff-young/) and [Dr. Kirsty Gardner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirsty-gardner/?originalSubdomain=ca) in [Blusson QMI](https://qmi.ubc.ca/).


My research interests lie in applied mechanics, where I apply experimental, numerical, and analytical methods to solve mechanics problems. I am particularly intrigued by interdisciplinary studies in MEMS, which involve integrating electrical and mechanical components with physics knowledge. My goal is to contribute to the development of innovative and efficient micro-scale devices.

I enjoy playing and watching football in my spare time. Check out my [blog](/blog/) for fun articles, and feel free to browse through my [CV](/CV/) and [gallery](/gallery) to learn more about me.
