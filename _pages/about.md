I am currently a 5th year engineering physics stduent at [UBC](https://www.engphys.ubc.ca/) and an undergraduate research assistant in [AMPEL](https://www.ampel.ubc.ca/), supervised by [Dr. John D.W. Madden](https://mm.ece.ubc.ca/john-madden/). Prior to this, I also worked as an undergraduate research assistant in [SimPL](https://simpl.mech.ubc.ca/), supervised by [Dr. Lyndia C. Wu](https://mech.ubc.ca/lyndia-wu/).

My research interests lie in applied mechanics, where I apply experimental, numerical, and analytical methods to solve mechanics problems. I am particularly intrigued by interdisciplinary studies in MEMS, which involve integrating electrical and mechanical components with physics knowledge. My goal is to contribute to the development of innovative and efficient micro-scale devices.




Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
